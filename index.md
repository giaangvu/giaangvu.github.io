# About Me

My name is Giang, an MA Statistics student graduating in December 2022 from University of Pittsburgh. I'm actively seeking employment opportunities in data science for 2023.

With a B.A. in Economics from Colorado State University, combined with research and industry experiences working with both financial and clinical data, I'm a very versatile data analyst with a strong statistical and mathematical foundation. 

I have three year of experience with R, 8-month industry experience with MySQL, and familiarity with Python, Minitab, SAS, STATA, and Matlab. 

I'm open to all data analyst positions, with a special interest in the healthcare industry.

**Hobbies**: Yoga, Pottery, Knitting, Cooking, Hiking
